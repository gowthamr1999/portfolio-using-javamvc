			My name is <span class="red">GOWTHAM R</span>. I was born and brought up in Bengaluru / Bangalore and I am presently based out
of same location.
<br>
My highest degree is a full time BE / B.Tech in Computer Science from Dayananda Sagar University,
Bengaluru that will complete in Jul-2021. My GPA out of 10 is 8.6.

My Computer Science degree(s) is giving a range of skills that I feel are crucial for my career and life. Despite
limited exposure, I have understood that hard work and determination can make anything possible. I am ready
to do that. Also, I am trying to develop a habit of reading current trends and industry news.
My project work(s) lasted for 8 Month(s) in total as I worked on Vision Based Target Detection and Positioning
UAV, Online Car Service Portal, An Archery Game using OpenGl and DocBot - Ongoing. I would like to add
that I am certified in 1 Month(s) Certificate Course in Web Application Developer.

When it comes to schooling, I secured 75.0% in my XIIth Karnataka Senior Secondary examination in 2017 in
English medium with 80 marks in Maths and 70 marks in English. In Xth CISCE(ICSE/ISC) Board, I got 75.0%.
During my schooling, I developed strong communication skills and also had the opportunity to participate and
excel in several extracurricular activities. Because of these exposures and experiences during my academic
years, I have gradually been able to develop effective communication skills. So, I can interact freely within a
team.
<br>
To add, I am also skilled in Advance Java ,  Python, Web Development using Python, Machine Learning, C++, Web Designing, Html5, CSS,
Javascript, Core PHP . I can read, write and speak in Kannada and speak in Telugu.
Lastly, I am a quick learner and believe in learning from my past mistakes. This is a virtue as it can take me
ahead in both my professional and personal life.
